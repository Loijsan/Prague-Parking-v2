Hello and welcome to my Prague Parking v.2 solution!

There are a few things that needs to be done before starting the program. 
I have chosen to use three different files for the different settings, so there are three different
files just for a bit more clear division of the information.

Before starting the program you need to change the pathways for these three files, that is esiest done by
searching for TODO in the project. Then it is just a matter of right-clicking on the correct file and choose 
"copy full path" and just replace "C:\users...." in the four places. 

The program contains more information about how it can be used, either you run the program and select 
"settings and help" and then "how to use the program", or you enter the Settingsmenuclass 
and scroll down to the bottom :)

Good luck!
