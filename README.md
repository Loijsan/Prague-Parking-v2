# Prague-Parking-v2
School project, it's a program that manages a parking garage, the biggest changes from the last project is that this program saves the information in text files, fills in information in the parking house from totally tree files, and that this project includes classes.

The program contains information about how it can be used, either you run the program and select 
"settings and help" and then "how to use the program", or you enter the Settingsmenuclass 
and scroll down to the bottom :)
